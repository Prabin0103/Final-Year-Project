\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Synergizing Smart Home with Smart Parking using IOT}
A smart house is a home with online gadgets that allow remote monitoring and control of electrical appliances and systems such as lighting and heating \cite{elhajj2019}. Smart home technology, also known as home automation or demotics (from the Latin “Domus” meaning “house”), that allows homeowners to manage smart gadgets safely, comfortably with less use of energy. Specifically, IoT may be regarded as a concept under which a group of goods/objects may be connected using communication without a physical connection to a wired network, Items can be linked to each other to develop a new job business or even prioritize another \cite{chuang2014}. With local population growth and financial growth, the number of vehicles on the road is growing steadily \cite{vaibhav2016}. Smart parking can be thought of as one of the Internet appliances which can help the car owners in parking their vehicles in a systematic manner using their mobile devices \cite{chen2011}. Smart Parking is a parking solution that can include smart built-in parking sensors, cameras, or counters. These devices are usually embedded inside or placed near parking lots to make sure parking is free and not crowded \cite{wang2011}. Parking is the most important problem for a big city.

\subsection{Applying smart parking system with internet of things (IoT) design}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Smart Parking System (SPS):}

 SPS refers to parking management system that combines cloud computing technology, database, and mobile devices in parking systems. The system created is not just an operational system for managing parking lots, but also storing information and accessing upto-date information on the condition of parking lots. The procurement of an automated parking lot operational system aims to provide fast, safe, monitored and transparent parking services \cite{fairus2011}.

\item \textbf{Internet of Things (IoT):}

The IoT (Internet of Things) is a computational concept that describes every physical objects can be connected to the internet and can identify itself between other devices. As for capabilities such as data sharing, remote control, etc., including objects in the real world. Examples are machineries, sensors, electronics, collections, any equipment, including people that are all connected to local and global networks through embedded sensors and are always active \cite{ardjuna2015}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{An IoT-Based Smart Home Automation System}
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system that allows devices to be connected and remotely monitored across the Internet. In the last years, the IoT concept has had a strong evolution, being currently used in various domains such as smart homes, telemedicine, industrial environments, etc. \cite{elhajj2019}. Wireless sensor network technologies integrated into the IoT enable a global interconnection of smart devices with advanced functionalities \cite{chuang2014}. A wireless home automation network, composed of sensors and actuators 
that share resources and are interconnected to each other, is the key technology to making intelligent homes. A “smart home” is a part of the IoT paradigm and aims to integrate home automation.

\subsection{RFID and IR Based Smart Parking System} 
Radio Frequency Identification is a
developing innovation that has been
around since mid 1900's and was utilized
in World War II. An early research paper
had investigated RFID work where the
creator of this paper expressed that
"Clearly, impressive innovative work must
be done before the field of helpful
applications is investigated". At that point,
the electromagnetic hypothesis identified
with RFID was concentrated in 1960's. Aside from that, creations as richardson
Robert's "Remotely actuated radio
recurrence fueled gadgets" occurred this
time, the wheels of RFID advancement
had begun turning. 1960's was the
beginning of the reception of RFID in
business exercises. A recognizable
advancement work around there had
occurred in 1970's the place vehicle
following, production line robotization and
so forth were the prime aims. By 1980's,
RFID innovation had come to fruition as
far as the full usage of the innovation. The
sending of utilizations utilizing this
innovation was seen in 1990's. The pace of
improvements in RFID is too obvious in
the 21st century where even the
unassuming of thing like material is
bearing a little clingy fix of RFID and
human implantation of RFID \cite{tang2006,chinrungrueng2007}.

\newpage
\section{Methodology}
\noindent
The development of this system will follow the Incremental Model of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the system is built and improved in multiple small modules (increments).Each increment adds new features while keeping previously developed parts fully functional. The process begins with requirement analysis, identifying the need for smart home automation,smart parking, and safety monitoring.

    \caption{Incremental Model}
    \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsection{System Architecture}
\noindent
The proposed AI system integrates IoT sensing, cloud storage, and machine learning to deliver real-time predictions for both energy consumption and parking availability. The system follows a multi-layer architecture consisting of an edge sensing layer (ESP32), communication layer (Wi-Fi), backend gateway/API layer, database layer, AI/ML processing layer, and application layer (mobile dashboard).\\
At the sensing layer, the ESP32 collects real-time readings from parking sensors (HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors per slot) and optional environmental sensors such as DHT11. The energy module uses either energy sensor readings (power/energy measurements) or a historical dataset captured from appliance usage logs. Raw readings are preprocessed at the edge to reduce noise (e.g., averaging ultrasonic distance values) and then transmitted over Wi-Fi using HTTP/MQTT or through Blynk connectivity.\\
In the backend layer, the API gateway validates incoming data, stores readings in the database, and forwards relevant features to the ML inference service. The database maintains raw sensor values, engineered features, and prediction logs to support both model training and monitoring.\\
The AI layer includes two machine learning models: (1) a Linear Regression model for predicting continuous energy consumption values (kWh/power), and (2) a Random Forest Classifier for predicting parking slot status (occupied/free). Linear Regression is used due to its simplicity and interpretability for energy prediction, while Random Forest is chosen for parking classification because it is robust to noisy sensor readings and can model non-linear decision boundaries.\\
Finally, the mobile application (Flutter) and dashboard (Blynk) display real-time sensor values and predictions to users. The system supports continuous operation where new data is logged, predictions are generated instantly, and the UI is updated accordingly.

% ---------------- Algorithm ----------------
\newpage
\section{Algorithm}
\subsection{Linear Regression for Energy Prediction}

\noindent


Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous value by establishing a linear relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).

In our system, Linear Regression is used to predict household energy consumption using sensor data such as temperature (DHT11), humidity, device usage status (light/fan ON--OFF), and time of operation.

The algorithm learns from historical data collected from the smart home and estimates how each feature affects electricity usage. After training, the model achieved approximately:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $R^2 = 0.6180$
    \item RMSE = 5.04
\end{itemize}

These performance metrics help the system monitor power usage and suggest energy-saving actions.

\subsection*{Mathematical Formula}

The basic Linear Regression equation is:

\begin{equation}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $y$ = Predicted energy consumption
    \item $\beta_0$ = Intercept (constant value)
    \item $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \dots, \beta_n$ = Model coefficients (weights)
    \item $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n$ = Input features (temperature, humidity, device usage, time, etc.)
    \item $\varepsilon$ = Error (difference between actual and predicted value)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cost Function (Error Minimization)}

Linear Regression finds the best fitting line by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

\begin{equation}
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_i$ = Actual energy consumption
    \item $\hat{y}_i$ = Predicted energy consumption
    \item $n$ = Number of observations
\end{itemize}
